**Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Katie Larkin, and I'm obsessed with rivers...so obsessed that I've made it into a career. I'm a PhD student studying under Dr. Ellen Wohl in the CSU Fluvial Geomorphology Lab. Here, you can learn a bit more about me, what my research interests are, and what I'm busy working on.**
