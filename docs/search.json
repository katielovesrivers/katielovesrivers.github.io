    "text": "Goofing around with my twin sister (left) at Water Holes Canyon\n\n\n\nI’m originally from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, but my interest in water was cultivated in my childhood through trips to the American Southwest with my family. Exploring canyons, riverbeds, and sand dunes was a formative introduction to the wild and wicked erosive powers of water and the incredible landforms that result. As early as first grade, I carried a mineral handbook around religiously and used my pocket money to start a rock collection.\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking out the volcanic vent at Kīlauea Iki at Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park!\n\n\n\nI never considered geology as a future until my freshman year at Washington & Lee University in 2018. My premed-chem-major aspirations were very quickly extinguished due to lack of interest, but a Planetary Geology class reignited a passion that had rested in the back of my mind since childhood. I declared geology as my major and took a class trip to Hawai’i to learn about volcanoes, igneous petrology, and geologic hazards.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a total station to measure channel geometry on the Maury River, VA\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t until junior year that I was truly exposed to the wonderful world of fluvial geomorphology. Summer 2021 was spent on an advanced project through the Keck Geology Consortium, where I collected field data to research regional groundwater geochemistry (cool, but not for me) and milldam-induced legacy sediment (now we’re talkin’!). I worked with a group processing data for the latter topic and tackled my own research project investigating long-term change in channel morphology and sediment dynamics following a dam removal. This personal project became my undergraduate thesis, and I graduated with Honors in Geology in Spring 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nA beautiful flooded coastal forest at Fort Belvoir, one of my jobsites.\n\n\n\nIn Fall 2022, I started as a Virginia-based field geologist for HydroGeoLogic, an environmental consulting firm, where I gained valuable expertise in water and soil sampling, report writing, and large-scale data management. While I enjoyed the growth this position afforded me, I knew I wanted to go back to school.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the field with my advisor Ellen (left) and labmate Shayla (right).\n\n\n\nIn Fall 2023, I started my MS in Geosciences under the guidance of Dr. Ellen Wohl at Colorado State University. I quickly fell in love with the academic community and the gorgeous mountainside setting of Fort Collins, Colorado. For my Master’s research, I studied wide, shallow, and lushly vegetated reaches of mountain rivers called “beads” and how geomorphic and biotic attributes make them more resilient to disturbances. I successfully defended in Spring 2025 - woohoo!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what a bead looks like from the ground. This one is Hague Creek in Colorado!\n\n\n\nBeads and flux attenuation have geomorphic and hydrologic implications at a reach scale and at a catchment scale. After studying reach-scale dynamics, I felt like I had another research mission…to zoom out my focus. Thus, my PhD was born! In Fall 2025, I started this new phase and am primarily researching the morphology, distribution, and modeling implications of storage reaches in mountain rivers of the Rockies and Appalachians. Now, you’re all caught up!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoying a hike at Sky Pond in Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\n\n\nAcademic journey aside, my personal journey has been equally exploratory. I ran cross country and track in middle school, high school, and college, but recently put down the sneakers and picked up a gravel bike. I found that I quite love long-distance rides (100+ miles) but being a grad student and wanting to spend hours in the saddle are not exactly compatible. I’m quite skilled in the kitchen and make a MEAN focaccia. I also find joy in thrifting and antiquing cool things, as well as making my own art (collaging mainly, but I’ve been getting into aluminum embossing) to decorate my space. Always true to my six-year-old self, I still collect rocks."

    "text": "Headwaters Channel Systems\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadwaters channels are extremely small (Ellen for scale) but important! These ones are tributaries of Neota Creek, located in the Front Range of Colorado.\n\n\n\nHeadwaters are disproportionately representative of total channel length in freshwater streams, accounting for a conservatively estimated 79% of their length in the continental United States (Colvin et al., 2019). However, they are poorly understood and widely unprotected, placing them at extreme risk of irreversible damage. All larger rivers originate from the headwaters, and efforts to preserve the sanctity of our waterways must include even the smallest channels. I am particularly interested in the relationship between climate, hydrology, and surface channel geometry, and how disturbances (wildfires, debris flows, etc.) can alter these relationships. There’s a lot we still need to learn about headwaters channels!\n\nStorage Dynamics in Mountain Rivers\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what a bead looks like from the sky!\n\n\n\nBeads are wide, vegetated, and typically valley-bottom storage reaches on mountain river corridors, generally interspersed with narrower transport reaches referred to as “strings” (Stanford &. Ward, 1993). River beads typically have greater accommodation space for surface and subsurface storage of materials, are effective at attenuating downstream fluxes, provide habitat and refugia for diverse riverine organisms, and increase resilience to disturbance in downstream portions of a river network, making them disproportionately determinant of river health./\nThe spatiotemporal connectivity that defines healthy river corridors means that we cannot reliably separate the reach from the watershed, so in order to fully characterize bead storage, we must examine it on both scales. On a reach-scale, I study geomorphic (water and sediment) and biotic (large wood and beaver modification) inputs into beads and how they contribute to the physical template that drives flux attenuation. On a catchment-scale, I examine regional controls (glacial history, lithology, drainage morphology) on bead morphology and distribution./\nBridging the gap between fieldwork and remote sensing\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote sensing could be used to estimate the volume of ponded water in this series of beaver dams on Corral Creek, CO.\n\n\n\nFieldwork is a core facet of fluvial geomorphology research, but costs, timing, and accessibility place limitations on where it can be done. In an increasingly automated and tech-centered world, scientists enjoy the availability of computerized analytical tools and value the efficiency and accuracy they can bring to research. However, a disconnect between field findings and remote methods can compromise data quality; investigations into strengths and weaknesses of remote sensing applications can inform fixes and increase public trust in these methods.\n\nProviding high-resolution, reliable remote data is made possible through sensitivity analyses, namely comparing remote estimates with field reality. I’m especially interested in capturing how well valley-bottom extraction tools and hydrologic routing models are able to characterize, respectively, the geometry and water/sediment storage implications of beads. I also am studying disparities between field and remote estimations headwaters channel/stream heads.\n\nReferences\n\nColvin, S. A. R., Sullivan, S. M. P., Shirey, P. D., Colvin, R.
